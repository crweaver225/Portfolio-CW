The great technological achievement of the 20th century was building digital computers to replace their clunky analog counterparts. The great achievement of the 21st century will be using those digital computers to simulate the analog devices they were meant to replace. 

In the basement of Fuld Hall at the Institute for Advanced Study in 1953, the birth of the digital universe was taking place. A computer inspired by Allen Turing's universal turing machine was being built and, unlike most of the analog computational devices that already existed at the time, this new digital computer was not limited to any specific task. This new device was designed to run any arbitrary set of instructions loaded into its memory one at a time. The instructions had to be painfully specific, but with a little bit of stubborn determinism, a programmer could prompt this machine to do anything computable. General purpose computing was born. Gone were the days of big clunky analog devices designed to do one thing and one thing only. These new digital devices could at one moment crunch the numbers in an excel sheet and at the next moment render a first person shooter video game. These new machines could simulate other machines that were simulating their own machines. The birth of this digital universe was accompanied by the birth of a new sense of inspiration and hope about the future. These devices would be able to do almost anything we imagined, or so we thought.
